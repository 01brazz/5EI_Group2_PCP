# 1  Introduction

The PCP Client is a java application that allows users who use it to connect to the PCP server and through a registration, log in with a user name and chat with other connected users.         The communication can take place in a public or private way depending on the will of the user.

# 2  Access PCP Client Code

An internet connection is required to access the PCP client code and connect to the site [www.github.com](http://www.github.com/).                                                                                                                                       The code can be found at this link: [https://github.com/01brazz/5EI\_Group2\_PCP.git](https://github.com/01brazz/5EI_Group2_PCP.git) .

# 4  System Graphics interface

## 4.1  Graphics interface

The user interface consists of a panel that contains an entry box where the username must be entered and a button to log in.

After pressing the button a larger panel will appear with two message display areas on the left public chat and on the right private chat.

Above the right panel there is a drop-down menu where you can choose the recipient of the private message, and on the left there is a slider to choose the communication mode.

At the bottom there is an insertion area where the message to be sent will be inserted and a button to send the message to its right.

The whole graphical interface was developed using Java Swing.
