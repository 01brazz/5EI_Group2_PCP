# Success Criteria for Potato Chat Project



The Potato Chat project will be considered a success if . . .

##### A fully functional app is delivered on or before December 6th


The system shall be delivered in a state that is ready to be used in its intended production environment for its intended purpose. The users will be able to use the app since they lauch it. We will consider both of these goals met if the users who plan to use the system during its test period fill out the attached Acceptance Test User Survey and:

- No one circles &quot;No&quot; on the first two questions

- If anyone circles &quot;Yes, with reservations&quot; on the first two questions, these reservations shall be resolved prior to April 4th to the satisfaction of the users with the reservations

**Concerns raised during the test period are addressed according to the problem resolution plan contained in the Software Project Management Plan**

All critical defects found before December 4 will be fixed. A critical defect is one for which there is no convenient workaround. Beyond fixing defects, requested changes will be handled on a sliding scale. Changes taking 30 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 3 weeks before the scheduled end of the project. Changes taking 20 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 2 weeks before the scheduled end of the project. Changes taking 10 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 1 week before the scheduled end of the project.

Users shall be notified of their rights and responsibilities under this policy prior to the start of acceptance test.

**Users can easily log into the system.**

This specifically means that a user will be able to choose an alias and an optional topic, write messages and choose who send the messages to.

**Potato Chat developers can make changes during the use.**

Specifically, a developer will be able to change parts of code while users are online. When changes are ready the app will be unable for 30 minutes, while developers will update the code. After that time users would be able to use the app again.

**Potato Chat supervisors won&#39;t be able to edit user accounts.**

This includes all accounts. All data won&#39;t be editable by supervisors.

**Exchanged messages aren&#39;t tracked**

This version of the Potato Chat doesn&#39;t include messages saving.

**No one can get private data**

Officers shall be able to download raw data on youth and their activities in order to produce ad hoc reports.

**The System is properly documented**

First, a user manual shall be produced and included with the system. This user manual shall be easy to understand for non-technical users familiar with basic Internet and spreadsheet concepts. This manual shall explain only how to use all features of the system.

Second, a system manual shall be produced. This system manual shall consist of the architecture document, as well as any additional material required to provide a technician with all necessary information needed to maintain and update the system. A single read through of this document and no more than 2 hours looking at the code should provide an appropriately skilled technician with all the information necessary to understand the system and make simple changes such as add a field to a generated report.

**Defects reporting**

Bugs or defects have to be reported to an administrator through a ticket on the dedicated section on the application
