|**Project Title:** Potato Chat  |
|**Start Date:** 18/10/2019                            **End Date:** 06/12/2019 |
| **Project Manager:** David Brazzarola |
|**Project Sponsor:** None |
|**Customer:** Antonio Sette|
|**Users:** 5EI Students|
|**Stakeholders and Expectations:** Team: Confront with the project manager to organize the work and the final product. Be synchronized on the project development.Antonio Sette: Have a working application to chat at project end. 5EI: Be able to use the application to chat together.|
|**Purpose (Problem or opportunity addressed by the project)**: Students who take advantage of the Potato Chat program will have an easy way to keep in touch. Currently students must use another application. Using this application users will be able to communicate in a local network. |
| **Goals and Objectives** : The overall goal is to give students an alternative way to keep in touch using the application. The app is expected to:  **1** Provide a desktop interface based on java.  **2** Function in a simple and intuitive manner.  **3** Provide students with locations to chat. |
|**Schedule Information (Major milestones and deliverables)**:   18/10/2019 – Subdivision into work groups. Development of a proposed protocol.  21/10/2019 – Software project development (analysis of examples and templates).  25/10/2019 – Start project development.  03/11/2019 – UDA software project development documentation.  08/11/2019 – Continuation of development of Chat projects.  15/11/2019 – Continuation of development of Chat projects.   19/11/2019 – UDA software project development documentation.  22/11/2019 – Continuation of development of Chat projects.   26/11/2019 – Software project development documentation.   28/11/2019 – Software project development documentation.  29/11/2019 – Continuation of development of Chat projects.   03/12/2019 – Software project development documentation.   05/12/2019 – Software project development documentation.  06/12/2019 – Completation of development of Chat projects.   10/12/2019 – Software project documentation with githHub and readTheDocs platform.|
|**Financial Information (Cost estimate and budget information)**: We were not given a budget for the development of the project. We have been given school resources like machines and software.|
| **Project Priorities and degrees of freedom:** There was an expiration date to be respected, further hours were added later. As already mentioned, the budget was not provided to us because it is not necessary for the development of the application.  The roles within the team have not changed, everyone has only one single task.|
| **Approach:** Iterative and incremental is planned.  Feedback will be used from one iteration to the next.  The first iteration will focus on basic functionality of the app.  Subsequent iterations will build upon that and incorporate more features as time allows.|
|**Constraints** : The application was developed for educational purposes only. It will therefore not be necessary to make it official at school bodies or offices.|
| **Assumptions** : The chat application is currently available and functional. It is not possible to interact with it through a website but only having downloaded it locally.|
| **Success Criteria** : The project will be considered a success above all if the chat application is functioning both public and private.  And finally if the team will be able to deliver the project respecting the delivery terms |
| **Scope** : The chat application will allow connected users to exchange messages in real time with multiple users, also if someone wants to interact with a single user, they can opt for a private chat.|
| **Risks and obstacles to success** : The risks that came to us were the absence of experience in the development of any application, this led to an initial confusion since we did not know exactly where to start. Furthermore, a risk was that of not being able to respect the delivery terms due to an incorrect time calibration, luckily our teachers came to meet us giving us more time..|
