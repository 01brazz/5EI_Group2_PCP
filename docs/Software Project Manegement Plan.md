# Overview

**Purpose and Scope**

The purpose of this project is to create a java application that allows you to connect to a server to take advantage of a chat service developed by our company.

**Goals and Objectives**

Objectives of the project:

1. Create software that fits the protocol used.

2. Create an elegant and functional graphical interface.

3. Increase the security of communications and data exchange.

**Schedule and Budget Summary**

The schedule summary shows start and end dates for high-level activities ending in major milestones or deliverables. Milestones are major events in the project life cycle that are used to measure progress.

A Gantt chart is an excellent tool for visualizing the start and stop dates of major scheduled activities.

The budget summary shows total project cost, possibly broken down into separate categories for such things as salaries, equipment, travel, overhead, etc.

**Success Criteria**

- Total project cost does not exceed 10% of the post-requirements phase estimate.
- All high-priority use cases in the requirements specification are delivered before December 10.

# Startup Plan

**Team Organization**

Project Manager: Brazzarola David

Programmers (3): Beltrami Andrea, De Giorgi Nicolò, De Iseppi Filippo

Graphic manager:Brusetti Karim

Build Coordinator:Brazzarola David

**Technical Process**

The team is committed to working divided into sectors, each component has a part of code to develop.

Once finished the developers will join the graph and will connect the graphical interface with the software code.

**Tools**

Partial Example

- Programming Language – Java
- IDLE - NetBeans
- Graphic Library – Java Swing

# Work Plan

**Activities and Tasks**

A work breakdown structure is an excellent tool for identifying a complete list of tasks.

Depending on the needs of the project, some or all of the following attributes will be recorded for each task:

- Task name
- Task Description
- Owner
- Effort estimate
- Planned start and stop dates
- Actual start and stop dates
- Dependencies among other tasks

**Budget**

There is no material cost for this project.

The biggest cost is the time in fact it will have to be done in 30 days.

# Control Plan

**Monitoring and Control**

Weekly –Team meeting. Project participants report status, progress and potential problems.

20/11/2019 – Critical Design Review. Formal inspection of product architecture.

19/11/2019 – Executive Review. The project manager presents current project status to the costumers.

# Supporting Process Plans

**Configuration Management Plan**

1. All work products will be stored in a centralized CVS repository running on a central server.

2. All project (work products) items (documents, source code, test cases, program data, test data, etc) will be stored in the CVS repository but not all will be under change control (subject to formal change control procedures.)

3. Items that are subject to change control will be considered baselined after a group review at the end of the life cycle phase during which they are created. Baselined here means that the product has undergone a formal review and can only be changed through the prescribed change control procedures.

4. The change control procedure once a product is baselined is: (1) anyone wanting to make a change to a baselined item sends an email to the rest of the group describing the change, reason for the change, expected impact, and timeline for integrating the change.

6. Including a change history with all documents is encouraged but only required for baselined documents.

**Verification and Validation Plan**

The Verification and Validation plan is specified as a separate documented located in the version control system at: https://github.com/01brazz/5EI\_Group2\_PCP.git
